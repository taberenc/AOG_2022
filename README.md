# The Adventures of Garnet

The Adventures of Garnet is an adult eroge game made in RPG Maker XP, created by qwerty123000.

AOG 2022 corresponds to Adventures of Garnet in the latest version of 2017 plus some updates done on Autumn 2022 with the intention of finishing the game, which story was left unconcluded.

## Requirements

* Windows 2000 or later.

## Getting the Adventures of Garnet in its 2022 version (the newer one):

From the Nightlies one, with some improvements and retouches. Just minor changes by now.
From the year 2017 can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/taberenc/AOG_2022

There, you go to "code" (green button on the upper right side) and there you pick "download zip file".
We've tried to upload all the necessary files in the same folders, order and names.
We try also that everything works fine. If there is any bug (and i guess that will be) tell me. 
Collaboration is wellcome.

## Known Issues and Workarounds


### Game.exe won't work, it just disappears and nothing happens.

If you get an error message that "'rxdatav.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command...", a required file is missing or corrupted.

First make sure that the file rxdatav.exe can be found in the Utility folder.

If the required file can be found in the Utility folder, there may be an issue with another application interfering with the executable. Try replacing the Utility folder with the old rxdatav (utility_old.zip), that can be downloaded from the projects [Downloads section](https://github.com/gegerlan/aog/downloads).

### FATAL ERROR: Failed to open executable

The location of the game is currently causing issues. Try moving it to another folder (e.g. directly to C).

### Buttons doesn't work properly.

If there's an issue with button presses not being registered or getting sticky, re- or uninstall any RPG Maker RTP you may have previously installed on your system.

### Changing equipment may not update the list correctly

Leave and return to the equipment view.
