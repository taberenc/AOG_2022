	Since Garnet is able, once has a high level, to wear a low def armor and resist attacks while is seen how the armor is chipped, torn and broken,
	the idea is give also to apron those states.
	Also, those states are still required for bunny suit, robe of the whore, latex outfit, and maybe chastity belt.
	
	The idea is to lower the def stats on all armors, along with their price within the game. Also to give armors EVA, STR, DEX, AGI and INT, 
		since most of them doesnt have any added.
	Then test the game and maybe lower the enemies power attack. The idea is to make armors more accessible, less durable, and 
		the whole game a bit easier for new players.
	Still have to figure out how to avoid that the magic bar (SP) gets drained automatically so fast.

	Added Maid Uniform pictures for chipped, torn and broken, both in normal and cuffed
	Added items on Dali shop
	Clairia shop now is open. will send different items depending on who is the buyer.
	Changed warnings on Bramble Woods West Junction
	Added sword graphic effect when the PC uses her sword
	Found a bug in Piercing shop at Carthage city. Added the old files of the maps about it. After checking it, it seems that works and 
		Garnet is able to have piercings now. They are useful to storage rings, as example.
			maps added:
		piercing shop and back of the shop (maps 85 , 86)
		sex shop at Carthage (not developed yet) (maps 83, 84)
	uploaded all the maps from the lastest version that ive got (29th june 2017), with the exception of the recently updated.
	repaired a bug on Clairia Crystal Meadow. Once inside, the exit had some problems. Now it seems to work fine.
	After creating an excel sheet about armors, weapons and shields, ive seen some things that require attention:
		there are armors with all the states (namely chipped, torn and broken) not included in the game, while others that are included
		lack of those states and are unfinished: iron armor, steel armor, mythril armor, latex outfit and robe of the whore dont have the
		cuffed version of the damaged states. Others only have the basic state. Others dont even have a drawing yet.
		So will be needed to give coherence to their prices, PDEF, MDEF, etc. and to finish their graphic side.
		First of all ill try to end those drawings, at least for the most important equipments. After that.. the whole thing
		should be rethinked (the relation between price and characteristics and also to include some of them on the game.

    Created a new GitHub in order to make the game downloadeable and editable.
    The current project is AOG_2022, which is a clone of the previous version from Gegerlan with the updates from 2017 uploaded.
    While the purpose is to make an ending for the game, at 1st it will be needed to try to fix bugs, make some minor changes and repair 
    the game difficulty process, which now scalates too fast to a hard difficulty at the beginning, while it seems to be a lack of resources in 
    the shop in Dali.

    given an opacity of 70% to "garnet underwear". As underwear, now has a hint of transparency.

Phantasmo 2017-06-27

    Added nudity checks upon leaving the Dali sewers. Prevents player from leaving the sewers nude when perversion is not
        high enough (since you are able to enter nude from the bath house).
    Minor revisions to dialog and events in the Dali sewers area.
    Modified perversion check in persona script (was still showing the "shy" graphic once over 250 perversion).
    Added outfit "Underwear" in Garnet's bedroom dresser drawer.
    Fixed the "Shame Check" so that the player is unable to move/interact with objects in the short window between Garnet's
        "embarassed" dialog and when the menu opens to get dressed (when attempting to go nude with too low perversion).
    Modified the arousal reduction speed to a fraction of its previous speed.
    Removed the battle timer restriction for changing armor during battle.
    
Phantasmo 2017-06-17 

    Added icons for existing and new outfits
    Character sprites for existing and new outfits (ALL outfits now have character sprites)
    Picture graphics for new outfits
    A few minor fixes to existing outfits
    Minor edits to menu scripts to fix cursor positions when exiting menus (exiting the menus would sometimes place 
        the cursor in a different position than the last selected menu, which is now fixed)
    Edits to the persona script to allow alternate base graphics (this allows for different hairstyles 
        like Chun Li, Vocaloid, and the new Samus hairstyle as well as alternate hair colors)

    fixed a bug that made garnet to disappear as shown image on the right hand. Happened that, at the beginning of the game
    the default status was garnet figther and not garnet adventurer. I think that this issue is fixed now. Upadated the file

    when is activated the clairia vip slave pass, garnet becomes voluntary slave
    then the card disappears and the slave collar appears
    now this event can be repeated
    when voluntary slave is active, garnet is like garnet the adventurer, but
        faces, pictures and graphs are like garnet the slave
        some events (by now the Dali pub ones) are similar to garnet the slave, with more anal and perversion
        the idea is to make an alternative branch to existing sex events in this way
    The way to remove voluntary slave status is talking to the older slave in clairia inn

    but as soon as they are already done, i think that worths it to use them.

    also opened the way to the "pier" on ikari far east.

    and changed the far west entrance to the sewer, in order to be make it look like more the down side of a well.
    moved also some enemies on the sewers that were bad located.

    dali sewers from pub. iS required be a waitress to be able to go to storage room of the pub, which connect to the sewers.
    Is a big map ready to store enemies, 
    events or maybe a quest. 
    changed the light of the sewers in order to make them more like a dirty area with some green (was pretended brown) color.
    new room added on the pub too.
    was added also a connection from the sewers to ren's sister home with a room ready for sexual stuff.
    added a kennel in carthage where to sleep like in the one of dali.
    done a new enemy on the sewers: a "red snake" (is not exactly like a snake, but nvm) that will rape garnet if she is nude.

    16 save slots

    The original game has only 4 slos for saving games. Is the default mode given by rpgMaker.

    In the folder called "16saveslots" you have a modified file called scripts.rxdata. 
    The file belongs to the game and has been modified in order to allow having more room for saved games.
    Is left to your choice if you use it because is not original. For use it, just change the original file 
    for the modified.
    Within the file, the modification was added on the debug section as new code after the original code.
    No original code has been deleted or changed in the process.
    With it, this file will let you to have 16 save slots in game, and not only 4.
    Source of the new code: http://forum.chaos-project.com/index.php?topic=1430.0
    For make it working, change this file for the original file within the game's data folder.

    modified the East Forest beside Hikari so, when you have found the crystal there 
    you can come back to that forest anyways again. Crystal is not there anymore, of course. 
    when you have done the crystal thing you can come back to that forest and, if you are dressed, ask for "fun" to a wolf. 
    if you are nude, they will just rape garnet at first contact.
    the SP that wolfs sex gives increased to 35, as already did tempmania with dogs.
    by the way, the entrance to the forest is not visible in the map, but if you go there you enter inside. 
    No need to press action button.

taber (burbujo32@hotmail.com) 2017-04-18

    Added a nighgown on the bathroom of garnets home. just for having one from the begining.
    And changed the properties of the nightgown, so can be used when garnet is slave. 
    In fact i think that suits very very well to that state.

    opened the door of ikary city: the done quest is: no crystal at the door; 
    guards/base of crystal ask you to go for it to a forest at east. you go east, to a forest. 
    crystal is there (upper - left), you take it, put it at its place. 
    you can enter to ikari, visit it, and leave from ikari now.

    opened the doors of the ikari sewers in order to search for the daughter of the king. 
    that quest is not finished but i though that it worths it to make the visit possible 
    and enjoy all the work that is already done.

    Updated passage to blocking for doll in Garnet Tile 55.
    
    Fixes #136
    
    If the tile used for en event can be threaded over willy-nilly, the event
    won't trigger unless you're right on-top of it (standing on it). That's an
    issue if the event you want to trigger is on something that that the
    player can't traverse, like the base of a pillar, which was the issue with
    the quest for a certain doll.

    The Dali Farm 1st floor interior exit to  Dali Farm (that takes the
    player to Dali Farm) were moved one tile south in accordance with

    walking along the south wall.

    Named events and updated remote switch calls.
    
    Updated the events so they should work better with the new merged map.
    Since the the old maps were separate the calls to toggle remote
    switches were firmly rooted in the index position of the event (and to
    some extend the index of the map) they needed rewriting to be rewritten
    for a new event indices (locations).
    
    Rather than having a fixed index reference, events were named and are
    now called based on their event names.
    
    Unfortunately we can't easily name what the switches (A/B/C/etc) means
    for the event, but at least it's clear what event we call when we
    modify them.

    Made the access in the Dali crypt more clear.
    
    - Added animation for the automatic opening of the first door.
    - Added animation for the opening of the boss door.
    - Changed the look of the first door to be more "tomb" like.
    - Changed the look of the boss door to be more "normal door" like.
    
    Since there's some confusion to what door the key goes to, I changed
    the first door to look more like a "tomb door" and changed the text so
    it isn't implied that you should "unlock" it (which would be the
    obvious use of the key you get right next to it). A short paragraph was
    also added for players that has the key in their inventory, so it's
    clear that the key isn't the solution to this "puzzle".
    
    The boss door was changed to a normal wooden door to make it clear that
    it has a different solution for unlocking.
    
    Changed the animation of the door unlocking, so the entire thing fades
    out after it has been opened. This is so we don't have the ugly black
    boxes that comes with the open doors in normal cases. A better solution
    could be to create doors with alpha-transparency, so they'd merge
    better with their surroundings.

    1st stage of map updates
    
    As far as I know, all maps that needed updating for the new tilesets are
    done. I haven't done a complete check of the maps so there are probably
    minor issues with some of the maps. Expect at least two more updates as
    there are still several maps that I'd like to combine, and the tileset
    database needs corrections made for game play. To keep everthing clean,
    I removed the old tileset entries and their related files.

    Adds editor items to the ignore list.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-09-14

    Moved static engine files to a seperate folder.
    
    Since many Git clients have a tendency to recommend committing that
    all files modified, some unfortunate consequences follow.
    
    In this case, the game is based on an older version of the RPG Maker
    Engine (1.02) which has a seperate dll (which ships with the game),
    and while newer versions of the engine is backwards compatible with
    1.02, the opposite is not true.
    
    The issue has been that developers have committed their changes with
    and updated definitions of what dll files to use, and what editor
    is compatible. This has basically broken it for players and other
    developers since unless they have the latest editor or RTP installed
    will get an error message they can't easily resolve.
    
    This solution is to keep the relevant files separate from where the
    editor and game reads and modifies them.
    
    The files are copied in as the user runs game.bat or editor.bat.
    Even if the files are modified on the developers system, the
    changes will not be sent upstream by default.
    
    If there's a need to update the static files, just copy the relevant
    files from the Game folder into Src\Required. All files in the
    Src\Required folder will be used to overwrite whatever is in the Game
    folder, and this can be used for other fixes as well.

Darkos619 <nicholas.m.clarke@hotmail.co.uk>	2012-08-28

    Just a quick fix to a few things I noticed
    
    For the Forced tranced event 0446 in the basement I had the text show at
    the top of the screen so the event wasn't blocked by text but I forgot
    to change it back to normal at the end and so it would affect other text
    boxs later in the game this has been fixed now.
    
    And the way to the basement for Tranced Force was left on the player to
    use the action button rather than just walk over it this has now been
    fixed as well.

    Forced Tranced Event for the basement
    
    Forced Tranced switch 0446 OW_Basement_2 map 240
    
    This is the same Event from the old hut map 239 just carrying.
    
    Its finshed as far as the graphics and talking I just need to go back
    and add sounds to the event.
    
    I also added Leon to the basement now for those with Forced Tranced on.

Darkos619 <nicholas.m.clarke@hotmail.co.uk>	2012-08-27

    New event for Forced Tranced
    
    New event for switch 0446 Forced Tranced on map 239 Old Hut
    
    So new event for Garnet walking into the hut at the wrong time.
    
    Main problem is with Leon for this update I know it doesn't look that
    great but for that graphic for Leon events 007-fighter07 is the closest
    looking one that is wearing something so thats why it is used if someone
    that is good with that kinda stuff could help with that it be great if
    not I'll look into learning bout that stuff later.
    
    I also now made it so those with forced tranced on can now enter the
    basement.

    Changing switch for Lance
    
    I've changed the switch to see Lance to Tranced forced 0446 from Tranced
    0444 and which one it turns off.
    
    I changed this because it fits better with Tranced forced than just
    normal Tranced.

Darkos619 <nicholas.m.clarke@hotmail.co.uk>	2012-08-19

    New Event Added for Tranced Switch
    
    Add a new switch called plant clone 0448 which is turned on by this new
    event the main idea behind this is for a few mini events for later.
    
    The changes to old hut map 239 is a autorunner for the event added this
    will work if Garnet enters the hut with the Tranced switch on 0444.
    
    As for the event this will tigger 1 of 2 scences depending how high the
    pervet variable 0049 is 350 or greater i'm not to sure on if that might
    be too high or low yet. I've used a self switch so the event does not
    happen again.
    
    Once either scene this finshed this will lead to the basement map 240
    which is another autorun event for the tranced switch 0444 also it can
    only be accessed if tranced is on.
    
    The basement event can be a bit buggy with the animeation for little
    parts and I can't seem to find the reason why as sometimes it works fine
    then another it messes up a little. I'll look into this again later as
    the effect is small for now. This is where the new switch plant clone
    0448 is turned on.
    
    One of my main thoughts about my events as a whole is I'm not sure if
    I'm making them too long this event is the longest of what I have done
    so far some feed back on this point would be nice thanks.
    
    Lastly is the 1st floor map 241 this is based on the new switch plant
    clone 0448 and you can only go up there for now if its on.
    
    This has a example of the mini events I mean for the plant clone switch
    0448.

    Improvment on event and fix for a bug
    
    Just more updates for old hut 239 making the event cleaner as when I had
    Garnet walking out of the hut she would have her armour on and then take
    it off again this is now fixed.
    
    The 2nd problem is if the naked ok switch was not on when Garnet got to
    the world map she would want to put her armour back on but the menu
    would not load so you couldn't move right now to fix that the event now
    gives 200 to variable 0049 pervert for now other than making the events
    require it i'm not sure on how else to fix it right now.

    Updates on spelling and improving current events and add new characters
    
    1st I've gone over a lot of the talking and found I have a habit of put
    Garent and not Garnet this has been fixed.
    
    I've added two new characters to Dali Village 001 at the table on the
    west side Lance and Alice Noels father and sister and they will only
    appear if switch 0444 Tranced is on say yes to them will turn Tranced
    off and a new switch Lance told 0447 will be turned on this is to make
    another line of events to happen which will be added later.
    
    Next i have improved my event on bramble woods 033 so that it is no
    longer on just one spot this needs switch 0039 on to play and it will
    turn switch Seen Noel on 0445.
    
    For the old hut 239 for event 006 I've improved it at parts for who
    Garnet is Tranced and added a self switch A to turn the event off rather
    than just using switch 0444 Tranced also for this event I found a bug
    that after the event for turning Trance on the player would be unable to
    move if they were shy this has been fixed for now by keeping the players
    colthes on I'll be working on a better fix soon.
    
    Added a 1st floor to the hut 241 this can only be acessed if switch 0444
    Tranced is on but has no events right now.

    This is not the best way of doing it, since it will do lookups with
    every frame, which we don't need. Unfortunately, since we use the same
    image for animation, we need to solve it like this, or alter the way we
    do animations alltogether.

    Fixes issue with knockout CE not triggering.
    
    If the is a knockout manager on the map that doesn't trigger as the
    player enters their kockout state (if the conditions aren't met by the
    page), the game will now use the default knockout manager to handle the
    event.
    
    The change to the code is a check if the list of commands retrieved is
    empty instance, by the first command having the code 0. Technically the
    command with code 0 does nothing in the engine, and is ignored; but
    since it can only be created when the command object is constructed
    (default value) as a new command is created (commands with code 0 can't
    be made in the editor), we assume that having a command with code 0 as
    the first command, means that the list is an empty construct.
    
    Another solution would have been to check the length of the list of
    commands. Since there's always and empty (code 0) commands at the end
    of the list, we know that any list with just 1 command is the same as
    having no commands. This is not used since we can't be sure that the
    commands passed actually follow this style of having an empty command
    at the end (since it isn't required by the engine), which would limit
    the usability of the function.

    Fixes training at dojo.
    
    Removes the ability to punch the pole, dummy, and stone pillar; if the
    player's HP is less than the damage done by the action.
    
    For some reason the knockout state doesn't kick in, suggestion there's
    something wrong with the damage dealing ability of the event commands.
    
    Damage done by enemies still work as intended, and will trigger the
    knockout state.

    Fixes dialog jump when starting book quest.
    
    Removed the proxy, since it made the NPC trigger two times when talked
    to from the north (facing south). The issue is that the player stands
    on one trigger (the proxy) activating it, and at the same time
    activating the event in-front of them. The result being that the event
    is triggered two times> directly, and indirectly.
    
    The reasons the proxy was there in the first place, was likely due to
    priority and clipping (passage) issues, where the player wasn't able to
    get close enough to the NPC to trigger it (see various merchants behind
    desks). Changes to the tileset has since made this obsolete, and at the
    same time introduced the double trigger bug.
    
    The book quest will now start as the player talks to the NPC the first
    time, rather than having to trigger the dialog a second time. If the
    player talks to the NPC without any books, they will trigger the second
    dialog where Garnet tries to convince the NPC to lend her books without
    returning them.
    
    If the player tries to trigger the NPC a third time without having any
    books, they will be reminded of the quest through a short dialog.

    Makes bladder switch event driven.
    
    Instead of updating the switch with every fixed bladder change tick, the switch will listen to any changes to the bladder, and modify its own value appropriately. Note that his may have some unintended consequences if it fires updates outside of the current interpreter iteration (i.e. things may disappear, or event may exit half way through), but I haven't seen any of that yet.
    
    This makes it possible to script changes to the bladder variable without having to wait up to 18 seconds for the game to realize this.

    Adds a bladder to the player.
    
    The player will now have a bladder that can be filled as the game is played.
    
    Turn ON Switch 173 to make the feature available.
    The current bladder value (how filled it is, 0-100) can be found in variable 21
    When the bladder becomes full, it will trigger switch 174 (which can be used to trigger common events or events on the map)
    
    The current update rate is 720 frames, with 1 being added to the 0-100 range. After 72000 frames the bladder will be filled. Since the game plays at 40fps, this means that you will have a filled bladder after 30 minutes (72000frames/40fps/60spm). Modify the FRAME_UPDATE constant to change the number of frames, or MODIFIER to alter how much is changed at a time (2.0 = double, 0.5 = half).
    
    If you change the MODIFIER you may wish to set FORCE_INTEGER = FALSE, so the value isn't rounded off into no change at all. You may want to keep FORCE_INTEGER on, if you intend to show the value in any way on the screen (besides the bar).

    Makes the hud more modular.
    
    Makes it possible to send arbitrary values and track them as bar on the screen.
    
    Hud is extended with add_bar_item that takes a name (key) and a block (callable, i.e. lambda/proc). The block returns an object containing the :current value, and the :max value.
    
    Example usage:
    
    hud.add_bar_item("player hp") do |callee|
      current_hp = $game_party.actors[0].hp
      max_hp = $game_party.actors[0].max_hp
      {:current => current_hp, :max => max_hp} # Pass values as an object to the script
    end
    
    If :max or :current differs from the previous value drawn, the specific bar will be updated.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-06-26

    Removes scripts binary file.
    
    The binary file was previously used to force users to run the batch
    files, even if they didn't read the readme (which many didn't). But this
    was problematic, since it constantly changes during development. The
    issue is that a developer may accidentally, or by the usage of his tool,
    commit the file anyway.
    
    If the changes are committed, it breaks the function of the file, and
    has to be reverted.
    
    Since some Git tools (like Github for Windows) by default want you to
    commit all the changes you've made; it's only a matter of time until
    this will cause a major issue.
    
    This commit aims to "fix" this, by removing the file completely from
    being tracked. Further changes needs to be made so we can catch those
    not running the batch files in some way, but this was clearly not the
    correct way of doing things.

    Makes maid uniform buyable.
    
    * Added a block to avoid NPCs walking behind the counter and blocking access to the bartender.
    * Upped the base price of the maid uniform to 150.
    
    You can now buy the uniform after the waitress quest. Also scripted sequence if the player sells the armor before finishing the quest.
    
    If the player runs of and sells the uniform, and can't repay the cost (bound to the cost of the armor in the armor definition), the debt will be added to the pimp's RPS debt. It's easier to leverage what we already have when it comes to the debt system, rather than implementing something completely new for the bartender. Alternatively we can have some sort of debt specifically for the guild, who would reimburse the quest givers for Garnet's failures.
    
    Pricing was set to be dynamic, so if the price of the maid uniform is altered in the armor definition (e.g. to something considerably higher), the event should still work as intended. Just remember that the player can leave the quest at any time, so don't make it too good, or the player will just start the waitress quest, and then just continue on with the rest of the game without finishing it.
    
    The event implements a simple script that makes the player randomly select an article of clothing from the inventory, if one exists (used when returning the uniform). I think this has been done before, but I couldn't find it, so it may be a good idea to move this script to a common event for easy access.

    Fixes some issues with waitress guild quest.
    
     * Fixed waitress dialog starting before speaking to the bartender.
     * Fixed issue with Garnet not remembering who she has spoken to.
     * Added stubs for getting a maid uniform.
     * Made the old man event require the maid uniform to trigger.
    
    This is a fix to solve some of the old issues related to the waitress guild quest in Dali. The main issue is that the system implemented history/remember what you do, rather it takes any action as the progression of the quest. Something that makes it possible to spam one action over and over again to finish the quest (e.g. you could speak to one person 8 times to clear the quest).
    
    This fix implements a simple binary list for history (for storing persons
    visited and persons reported). This is simpler than using self switches
    since the inside of the pub is rather complex for the events (could have
    required a new map completely) and doesn't require more variables or
    switches to clutter the global scope.
    
    Variable 50 now is now a binary array with different index values for different events in the quest.
    Index 1 : Quest started.

    The pimp and his friend is not in the list, since Garnet will refuse to speak to them. This is the old behaviour and the quickest to implement for now. Index 9 and 10, 19 and 20; has been reserved just in case we want to have them more active during the quest.
    
    To check any of these values you can create a conditional with the following script:
    
        $game_variables[50] & ( 1 << index ) != 0 # See if index is set
    
    $game_variables[50] being variable 50 (Work) and index being the number to check, e.g. if you wish to check if the captain has been spoken to you type the following
    
        $game_variables[50] & ( 1 << 4 ) != 0 # See if the captain has been spoken to
    
    To set the variable you can use the script event command, and the |= operator, e.g.
    
        $game_variables[50] |= ( 1 << 7 ) # Set Demeter as spoken to
    
    The quest is considered complete when index 12-18 is turned on when speaking to the bartender.

    Fixes some minor typos with farm girl.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-06-07

    Fixed BGM on world map.
    
    Changed the settings of the map to play 018-Field01, rather than having a parallel event trigger it. This was done by right clicking on the map in the editor's map list, and selecting the music under the Auto-Change BGM option.
    
    The reason you don't want to use a parallel or autorun event, is that the event by default will try to run the event again once it done.
    I.e. for every frame you're on the game map, the game will try to re-play 018-Field01, which isn't needed and has a negative impacts on performance.
    
    If you wish to use events to change music through an autorun or parallel event, make sure that the event page doesn't repeat by using self switches, or use the erase event command. This is true for all usage of autorun or parallel events, and failure to adhere to the principle of breaking the loop may result in unexpected behavior in the game, and poor performance.
    
    For music and background sound effects, modify the properties of the map, since it's specifically made to manage this functionality.

    Added methods to game_party for getting aggregate data.
    
    You can now get some stats on the inventory, mostly related to money. Check liquidity and what is locked in usage (equipped).
    Intended to be used when checking how wealthy a player or her party is, and maybe if there's someone willing to barter for some liquidity in special circumstances.
    
    One possible use is to have a merchant offer money for an item that's equipped (i.e. in use by the player), when she doesn't have things to sell in her inventory, or money at hand to buy things. Another possibility could be to implement it when playing a game, so the equipment can be used to cover the bet.

    Blocked Dog Garnet from entering Potts.
    
    Stops the player from triggering unwanted events by blocking the access to the building when the dog switch is turned on. This is to avoid confusing situation as the player gets scenes that isn't expected from a dog.

    BlizzABS hud will now check for SP int changes.
    
    Updated the hud system to look for changes in whole numbers, rather than decimals, when deciding to redraw the bars. This will make the script call the draw function, hopefully improving performance.
    Also removed the force update of the sp when hp is changed, not sure if it's needed, but I didn't see anything that suggested that.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-05-09

    Made sp_cost return an int, rather than a float.
    
    sp_cost contains the number of time a spell can be cast, given the current mana pool. This makes sure that this value is an integer i.e. you can cast this spell 2 times, rather than 2.4321456731345 times.
    
    The reason this was changed is mostly for aesthetics, but also for a test to see if it has any impact on performance. Testing using kellessdee's Frame Rate Display, suggests that this change didn't have a noticeable impact displaying it as a float or an int.

    * Replaced usage of S38 (Haunted Field) with self switch.
    * Made it so the knocked out Garnet's sprite is more appropriate given what the player is wearing.
    * Removed usage of proxy events to move the player (the player moves now instead), to avoid issues with different sprites.
    * Fixed south wall inside the shrine.

    Fixed regression bug with rape skill and dog Garnet.
    
    When the rape skill is called, the target is checked with is_nude? rather
    than switch 90 (nude).
    
    Dog Garnet doesn't trigger the nude switch when no equipment is worn.
    Breaking the script as the game tries to retrieve the max hp of an armor
    that doesn't exist.
    
    I don't remember why dog garnet doesn't trigger switch 90. It was probably to solve page condition issues. We should evaluate if this should remain the default behaviour.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-05-05

    Lowered damage to clothes during rape attack.
    
    Checks are now if...
    
      player.agi > enemy.str + d+enemy.str
    
    Damage done is now calculated by the following...
    
      base_dmg = (enemy.str * d+enemy.str) + d+enemy.atk
    
    i.e. base_dmg can be up to str^2 + atk
    base_dmg is not allowed to exceeds 1/5 of the clothes hp. This is OK for normal goblins and the cotton robe, but I'm not sure how well it is when we go further down the line with armors like mythril (80k vs 1.1M hp).
    
    *d+ is a dice roll, min 0, top is the value right of the plus.

    B will now always be turned Off for the door to the west, after the goblin
    was killed.

    Fixed incorrect delete_at call.
    
    Changed to parentheses for the delete_at call, making the index a param, rather than trying to get nothing and treating the returns as an array/hash.
    This fixes the bug where the game would crash if the player tried to get a mature bond.

    Changed persona shyness behavior.
    
    Upped the limit before losing shyness to 250, this is 50 than required to streaking.
    The old value was connected to the old perversion system, where the value would range between 0-10, which has been changed.

    Fixed issue with selecting a variable in debug tool.

    Change the teleport target one tile down, due to changes in the exterior building map.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-03-17

    Made the old hut exterior look more like ruins.
    
    To make the old hut look better, and more in-line with the interior, I changed it so it looks more like ruins than a copy-pasted building.
    Added a chest that will make the player interested in entering the ruins. Once they've entered the interior map (M90) and opened the chest, the event will update to an opened chest (i.e. showing that you've already been here).

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-03-17

    Added some trees around the old hut.
    
    To make the new look of the old house less of a surprise, I added some trees around it.
    This meant that I had to move the coastline one tile to the west.

    Added :set_graphics to Game_Character
    
    The sprite definition in the Game_Character abstraction, can now be changed by calling :set_graphics(character_name, character_hue, [direction], [pattern])
    This is a workaround for having to call move_route to set the sprite for a character, which may be required when working with dynamic sprites.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-02-14

    Added new attack/event trigger fix.
    
    Found that the issue was with the explicit sprite setting for the player, rather than the actions done in BlizzABS. Removed old fix and deleted explicit setting of sprite through force route.

    Fixed some patching on the top left.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-02-12

    Added support for custom modifiers to equipment.
    
    Armors and weapons now support custom modifiers (in the form of decimal percentage).
    
    Supported modifiers
      price - The cost or sales price.
      atk  - The attack rating, damage and hit rate.
      pdef - Physical defense.
      mdef - Magical defense.
      str_plus - Strength improvement.
      dex_plus - Dexterity improvement.
      agi_plus - Agility improvement.
      int_plus - Intelligence improvement.
      repair_cost - Cost of repairing item (based on condition and price)
      eva - Evasion (armors only)
    
    Since it is based around percentages, base values of 0 will of course not be modified.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-02-12

    Added :hp and :max_hp to Condition_Item

    Animated the sequence when the player enters Ran's holding area.
    
    Since the camera/map makes it hard to actually see Ren, a small cutscene was added where the player moved up to the bars, and notices that Ren is inside it (with a small camera movement).

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-02-11

    Changed transport location from Goblin Cave to World Map.
    
    Move the exit location from the Goblin Cave so the player doesn't get stuck on the new world map. The world map was also modified to have have an entrance back to the Goblin Cave, like the old map used to have. The shrine was moved further to the east, so it wouldn't be right on top of the new entrance/exit. The new area visible on the world map (since the teleport moved east) was added.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-02-11

    Added check to see if the import was successful.
    
    When the player tries to run the executable, it will now run Import.bat, and make sure that we actually got things imported before trying to restart the application. This to avoid getting the game stuck in a vicious cycle of restarts, if the import failed.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-02-10

    Removed ability to leave to the left.
    
    Fixes issue with player getting stuck if they backtracked after the event
    in the muramasa shrine. Leaving the map to the left (rather than bottom
    right), and then re-entering the map would freeze the player during the
    cutscene. This fixes it by removing the ability to leave at any other
    direction then bottom right.

    Image Cleanup will now remove the image after hiding it.
    
    Related/fixes to issue with Show Persona CE showing the last frame of the animation last played. Rather than just making Picture 2 only fully transparent, Image Cleanup CE will now erase it as well.
    
    Previously the persona system used picture 2 for rendering Garnet on screen, but since this was moved to the back-end, picture 2 wasn't updated after an animation had stopped. What remained was the last animation slide shown on screen which would show when the game thought it was supposed to show Garnet's persona.
    
    Thus, calling Show Persona (deprecated) will no longer show the last animation frame on the screen.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-01-25

    Removed show persona call from librarian.
    
    The librarian called the deprecated Show Persona CE, but this in turn is bugged, showing the last image used in an animation. This is because the persona system doesn't update Picture #2, which is also used for animations.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-01-25

    CE that was used to support the old persona system has now been prefixed with the word DEPRICATED, so they'll be easier to find in events.

    Added arousal and perversion to Maito Dojo.
    
    Added changes to arousal (SP) and perversion (V) during and after sex scenes.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-01-17

    Added perversion check for Maito Dojo.
    
    The player is now required to have a high perversion rating to start the initiation. Dialog has been added to reflect this.

nt for the doll.
    
    To avoid confuDate:   2012-01-15

    Added initial text for sleeping Billy.
    
    During the book quest, the player can now try to retrieve the book from Billy while he's sleeping.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-01-14

    Added dialog for Alice and Billy's bookcase.
    
    The player will now have some text if the visit the bookshelf in the second floor of the farmhouse. The text depends on the context of the library book quest, guiding the player to visit Nicky (if they haven't) at the start of the quest, and direct them to Billy if they've spoken to Nicky. If they got the book, it will use the default text.
    
    There may be a conflict if the player has had sex with Billy before, where the default dialog may show up when interacting with the bookshelf. Hopefully it's generic enough, and highlight that the book can't be found at this location.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-01-13

    Opened the troll cage, and added an event for the doll.
    
    To avoid confusion which door to open, I opened the caged area in the troll den. I also made sure that the doll has an event that identifies what it is, and that it's not related to Sorai's quest.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-01-09

    Changed perversion variable and arousal.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2012-01-09

    Fixed issue with perversion not being additive.
    
    Change from settings perversion, to adding to perversion after the sex event.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-31

    Made the batch script close after Game.exe starts.
    
    To make it prettier, I made Game.exe start as a seperate instance (and not
    inside the bat script). The cost may be the error messages, since these
    would probably be hidden from the user, with the window closing rather
    quickly.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-31

    Added script for when user doesn't run Game.bat
    
    If the player tries to run Game.exe as the first thing they do, they'll
    now get a message and the game will try to run Game.bat. If Game.bat can't
    be found, the window will closed after providing an error message.
    
    I was unable to get the linebreaks (newline) to work for some reason in
    the error messages. I'm not sure if the alert window can't handled escaped
    characters, or if I'm just doing something wrong.
    
    If I write "foo\nbar" I'm expecting "foo
    bar" not "foo\nbar" that I'm not getting.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-22

    Reset the animation sprite for the door.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-22

    Updated to look of the Dali dojo.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-22

    Update look of blocked path out of Bramble woods.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-22

    Added arousal and perversion change to Marco's scenes in Dali.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-22

    Moved Evans closer to the show.
    Moved hidden gold.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-22

    Fixed transitions in Marco's show.
    Changed the fading so the transports won't be so glaring during the event. Moved most of the fades so they finish blackening the screen before changes are made to sprites and character transparency.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-22

    Fixed Marco priority issue in Dali Church.
    Un-ticked the always on top flag for the sprite, so Marco stops standing on Garnet's hair.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-20

    Fixed knockout event for dogs in Dojo.
    Changed from erase knockout event, to exit event after the player has gone through the default knockout process. Not sure why this had to be done since both should have the same result in this case.
    There may be issues with the script that manages map based knockouts.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-19

    Fixed Garnet dog knockout in Dali dojo.
    Added condition for Dog Garnet for the dojo map's knockout event. Rather than playing out the default event, it will now call the default knockout manager (which at the time of writing means a game over, or a move to the guild house). A unique dog only event could be written if so wanted.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-19

    Added an extra dog page for Madison.
    Madison's dog page was copied and made trigger with the S113 condition. S111 is set to OFF after speaking with Ran (for some reason) so extra instructions are required to capture the sequence after Madison is returned, but before Ran has been spoken to; and after Madison has returned, and Ran has been spoken to.
    Since this is a linear quest, maybe using a variable would have been a better solution, or treat switches as completed states, not changeable after they've been set.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-18

    Updated movement of the goblin first time Bramble woods is visited.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-18

    Update bramble woods map (the first map after leaving Dali)

    Removed image duplicates and empty sprites.
    Removed fixes for BlizzABS's sprite requirements.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-16

    Added fix for missing weapon sprite.
    If the game decides to use the weapon 'character' (i.e. animate the weapon) it will now handle missing images better.
    If the weapon sprite is missing, by default the previously working bitmap will be used. Otherwise, an invisible, 1x1px image will be created and used in its place. It would probably be a good idea to wrap all the cache calls with this, to avoid crashes in the future.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-16

    Added dog & passage to Carthage check for book in Felix house.
    Made the retrieval of the book not have Felix talking when he isn't there.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-15

    Made Felix dialog work when Garnet is a dog.
    Copied the dialog from the actor condition from the first page to an new page that has the dog switch as a condition.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-14

    Removed slave dialog from old lady roaming Dali.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-14

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-12-14

    The game will now try to use the last successful sprite used for animation, if the new can't be found.

    Set page id for common event.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-11-27

    Added CE33:V40->Perversion, to dump variable 40 into player perversion.
    To bypass the tolerance when adding to the perversion rating of the player, CE33 can now be called after setting variable 40, with the addition/removal to the perversion rating.
    The standard behavior of the perversion system is that the more an event (and it's specific page) changes the perversion rating, the less effective it is. In circumstances where this needs to be avoided, calling :add_perversion is possible, with the unique id set to 0. In this case we automate the process by allowing the setting of Variable 40, and then calling common event 33, so the designer doesn't have to use the script event command.

    Added dialog placeholder on Main Road.
    Added BusterGT's dialog written about the necklace as the player rescues an older gentleman. Placing it in-game so it's versioned, and won't accidentally be removed.
    Needs to be animated and have faces attached. Minor modification may be required for consistency in the dialog.
    Not connected to a specific quests, so it's up for grabs.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-11-08

    Added nil check for .start method for map event.
    Added nil check to avoid issues with .start commands in events crashing the game. If the target event doesn't have a page where the conditions aren't met, the @list variable containing all the event commands that supposed to "start" isn't init. before it's used.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-11-08

    Fixed Ren sisters merchant trigger.
    Fixed issue with game crashes if the player triggered the merchant in Ren sisters' home, if no merchant is available.
    Problem is that the @list variable isn't set, crashing the game by calling a nil variable.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-10-30

    Set bush flag on for most water tiles in tileset main1.2
    Updated T54 (main1.2) to have the bush flag set to ON, to have the player (and other events) look submerged in the water, instead of being on top of it. T54 is used in Dali bath and Garnet's house's bath.
    Some of the tiles that have water, do not have the bush flag turned on since the players location relative to the tile, made it look very awkward. Most notable is this with the tiles that have borders in the bottom (south) part of the tile.
    Change was triggered by a notice from Rucian Alves Pereira, on the Hongfire message board.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-10-29

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-10-25

    Added climax check for Dali Bath in.
    Didn't add check for g+g since... well, it's one-sided. The SP change that exists highlights the problematic use of a meter for both perversion and arousal.

    Fixed issue with scientist not being removed.
    
    - Added empty page with condition self-switch A.
    - Replaced "erase event" with "set self-switch A ON"
    
    Erased events will only work for the duration of the time the player is on the map. Once the player leaves and returns, the event that was removed will have returned.
    
    This is because the state of the maps aren't save in the save games.
    
    What is saved on the other hand are the self-switches, so a solution for this issue is to set a self-switch that informs the game not to use the event you want removed.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-10-01

    The scientist will no loger walk on the spot.

    Packaged rxdatav with OCRA.
    
    Changed from using ruby2exe to ocra for packaging rxdatav. Hopefully this means that users with non latin1 usernames will have an easier time with getting it to work.
    
    Orca didn't capture all of the scripts in one executable, making us store them in a seperate folder. This means that we may actually be able to work on the script properly.

    - Added pages for slave and dog for priestess
    - Added page for dog for priest
    
    Not sure of some of the faces, it's not clear if Garnet is coerced as a 'slave', but I don't think she is, given her affection when not being under the spell.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-28

    State tracker now verifies that the name passed and converted is a valid constant in ruby.

    The images can be added in the pictures folder at run-time and work in the game.
    
    Added direct read access to weapon and armors for the Game_Actor.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-28

    Imported the well map from the Tilldeed project. Added slime rape sequence. Added slime and slime boss as enemies.

    Changed entrance from rope ladder, to cave opening.
    Modified all enemies to use new enemies slime (35) and slime boss (36).
    Added a small reward at the end.
    Added CE335 Rape:Slime. Not sure how much of this is what I did, or what Reploid345 originally made, so there may be a reason to change this sequence to avoid conflict.
    Updated world map and added entrance in the mountain north of Carthage.
    Updated default rape manager, to hide the player by default.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-28

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-26

    Fixed issue with missing bunny image for the persona.
    
    Since the system looks for an image with the same name as the equipment worn, the images needed to be changed from just being "bunny" to "bunny suit".

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-25

    Moved modifiers into the condition classes. Fixed issue with selling equipment.
    
    Update sell classes to use items, rather than index, and to check for the condition classes instead of RPG::Armor and RPG::Weapon.
    
    Condition_Item
     def quality -> condition
    
    Game_Party
      weapons <- readable
      armors  <- readable

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-24

    Added individual item tracking for weapons and armors.
    
    Added the ability to track the condition of armor (Armor_Condition) and weapons (Weapon_Condition).
    By default the max_hp of an item is price * pdef.
    Armor_Condition and Weapon_Condition works as adapters for RPG::Armor and RPG::Weapon, making it possible to call the native methods through them (modifiers etc)
    
    Added a value of 200 to cotton robe to make it more durable.
    
    
    Game_Party now stores its weapons as Weapon_Condition, and armors as Armor_Condition.
    gain_weapon/gain_armor now takes a Weapon_Condition and Armor_Condition object, as well as the default ID (will create the appropriate object)
    lose_weapon/lose_armor now takes a Weapon_Condition and Armor_Condition object, as well as the default ID (will take n of the worst quality items and remove them)
    
    Scene_Equip, Window_EquipItem updated to use objects (Condition_Item) instead of index.
    
    Game_Actor now stores the current weapon in @weapon.
    .weapon_id -> @weapon.id (Weapon_Condition)
    .weapon_id=id -> equip(0, id)
    
    Game_Actor now stores the current armors in @armors, index 0-4.
    .armorsN_id -> @armors[N-1].id (Armor_Condition)
    .armorsN_id=id -> equip(N-1, id)
    
    def unequip_weapon
      Adds the current weapon to the party inventory, and removes it from the actor
    
    def unequip_armor(armor_slot)
      Adds the current armor to the party inventory, and removes it from the actor
    
    def equip_weapon(id)
      Removes the item from the party inventory, and adds it to the actors. Creates a new Weapon_Condition if passed an ID.
    
    def equip_armor(id, armor_slot)
      Removes the item from the party inventory, and adds it to the actors. Creates a new Armor_Condition if passed an ID.
    
    def equip(equip_type, id)
      Piercings disabled.
      Simplified from original.
      id 0 or nil removes unequips, while given an ID or object will equip
      type remains the same (0 = weapon, 1-4 = armor)
    
    Extended base_str
, base_dex, base_agi, base_int, base_atk
, base_pdef,
    base_mdef, base_eva
 to modify the value based on the state of the equipment.
    
    get_quality_modifiers(sym)
      get the quality modifiers from armors and weapon with the given sym (e.g. :atk for atk)
    def get_weapon_quality_modifier(sym)
      get the quality modifiers from weapon
    def get_armorN_quality_modifier(sym)
      get the quality modifiers from armor N
    
    
    class Game_Battler
 updated to deal damage to weapon and armors
    
    def damage_weapon(damage)
      deal damage to current weapon if any is used
    
    def damage_armorN(damage)
      deal damage to armorN if slot N is in used
    
    def do_damage_armor(attacker, modifier, damage, critical)
      calculate and deal damage to all armors based on dmage recieved.
      There is a damage pot that is shared by all armors. Each item takes turn in removing dmg from the pot based on their m/pdef, removing some damage from the pot before handing it over to the next item.
      The order for the damage taking is:
        Shield (2) (removes 2x the damage if blocking) -> body armor (3) -> helmet (1) -> accessories (4)
    
    def do_damage_weapon(target, damage, critical)
      calculate and deal damage to weapon
      if damage done is less than 85% of the base attack rating, the weapon will take some damage.
    
    
    
    Save Game fix added in TEMP_Party_Equipment, hopefully this will fix most issues.
    
    
    Haz_Armor updated not to use the newer inventory format for $game_party
    
    
    Known Issues:
    * Shops will looks strange since they haven't been updated
    * Piercings have temp. been removed while we're rewriting how items are equipped

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

    Locked body armor from player during combat.
    
    CE16 - Set Class Equipment fixations
      Sets the default fixations for classes
    
    CE25 - MapState: Battle
      Fixates armor3 (body armor) at the start.
      Calls CE16 Set Class Equipment fixations at post, before equipment update.
    
    CE16 should be implemented in CE2-4

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

    Fixed issue with states with multiple words crashing the state tracker script.
    
    States with two or more words aren't valid constants (since they use space), so it ended up crashing the game.
    
    Space and tabs will be changed to _ before checking the consts of StateTracker.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

    Cut physical and magical protection of the cotton robe in half.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

    Using the chastity belt will now cause the rape skill to fail.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

    Made the rape skill's ability to tear off clothes dependant on the def of the cloth item.
    
    There is now a check if the enemies strength +d50 is greater than pdef of the cloth item, before removing and destroying it.
    
    This should make it better at the start of the game, but is still a mess later in game.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

    Lowered the priority of all enemies to use the rape skill by one.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-23

    Added fix for event using tiles not using the tile passage definitions.

    Added default rape event for harpy.
    
    CE314-Rape:Harpy

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    CE311-Rape:Lizardman
    CE312-Rape:Kerberos
    CE315-Rape:Gargoyle

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Added the rape skill to Cobold enemies, made the rape event shorter.
    
    Rape skill was set as a priority of 5 for enemy 5 (Cobold)
    
    Cobold are the enemies found in the swamp.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Added fix for setting direction with graphics (i.e. using the fist row).
    
    Some strange issue with the first row of the spriteset not setting the direction correctly. Managed to find the issue in the custom movement part of Game_Character, but has been unable to figure out how it is actually impacting the game as it does.
    
    The changes are done to command 41 (change graphics) where the check if the direction passed differs from the original one before making modifications, was removed.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Made the skeleton boss a skeleton.
    
    Set the boss to be event 17 (Skeleteon), which is the visual representation of him. This mainly to avoid possible issues with him using the rape skill, and turning into a zombie.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Added stub for Cobold and Zombie rape events.
    
    Copied parts of swamp GOR to CE305 - Rape:Cobold
    Made a simple zombie rape implementation based on goblin event in CE309 - Rape:Zombie
    
    Removed Rapist enemy (debug stuff) from CE+enemy list.
    
    Added rape skill as a priority 3 action for zombies.
    Was unable to get Cobold working as intended. (Direction isn't getting fixated, making the wrong animation play)

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    CE for Big Goblin event.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Added stripping of event names to avoid issues with unintended spaces when calling for events to execute.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Added rape as a skill to the big goblins and the execution as a CE (shared by all enemies).
    
    CE:304 - Rape:Big Goblin
      More or less a copy of Goblin CE. To overwrite: create a map event and name it: Rape:Big Goblin.
    
    No sound added.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Made hp change as event commands not trigger game overs.
    
    There was an issue where scenes would lead directly to game over, rather that calling the knockout CE.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-22

    Interpreter
      call_common_events_by_name(event_name) 
-calls all common events with the given name

      index_common_events - creates an index of all common events based on their name
      get_event_by_name -> get_events_by_name - changed to signal that an array is given (rather than one event)
      get_event_by_index - as an alternative to using names
      call_event - now get's the page of the event and relies on call_page to pass it on for interpretation
      call_page - given one or more pages will now retrieve the commands from the page and pass it on to call_command
      call_command - set's one or more commands as the workload of the interpreter
    Game_Event
      page - the current page is now publically readable
      condition_met?(page)
- if the condtions ofthe page are met (set in editor)
      get_page_by_index(index, meet_conditions)
 - gets the page at the provided index, does checks if conditions are met if requested (TRUE)
      get_page_by_name(page_name, meet_conditions) - gets the pages that has a comment with the format "name:page_name" e.g. "name:my_page" that has the passed name. Checks conditions if requested (TRUE)
      index_page_names
- indexes the name of the pages. Checks the 6 first commands of each page by default for a name. This can be modified by altering the const INDEX_DEPTH_MAX.
    
    
    Events overwriting the knockout CE are now required to be named "Knockout Manager"
    Changed the name Knockout -> Knockout Manager on several maps
    
    When the rape skill is executed, it will now first run CE45.
    If player is nude:
      if no event named "Knockout Manager" exists on map:
        run CE300 - Default Rape Manager
      end
    end
    
    CE300 in turn checks the name of the enemy and looks for events on the map or as a CE. E.g. for a goblin:
    if no event named "Rape:Goblin":
      find and run common events named "Rape:Goblin"
    end
    
    Rape:Goblin (CE303) in turn plays out the scene, as if it were an event on a map.
    
    Example of overwritten behaviour can be found on map 33 - Bramble Woods _junction [KTS]
    
    
    Fixed issue with persona showing up when it shouldn't (due to using switches to set visible state in update persona 2)
      Hide Persona -> Switch 127 = on
      Show Persona -> Switch 127 = off

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-21

    Added knockout CE and added overwriting knockout events on specific maps.
    
    By default getting knocked out will now move the player to the adventurer guild (if a member) with some penelty, or game over the player.
    On some maps (GOR) seperate knock out events have been added for these specific situations.
    
    To create an overwriting knock out event, simply create an event anywhere on the map, and name in knockout
    You can use page condtions for specific actions, but the name is the only thing required for this to work.
    
    CE:70 - State:knockout
      Executes when the switch for knockout is ON.
      Tries to execute events on the map with the name knockout, if non exists calls CE100 (default knockout manager)
      Removes knockout state at the end (and thus will only run once)
    
    CE:100 - default knockout manager
      Moves the player to adventure guild in Dali.
      Removes half the gold the party has.
      Replenish half the health.
    
    Most of the parallel events have finally been removed from the maps.
    
    
    Added a check for the map battle in shame check. This to avoid being asked to equip something when having clothes torn off while in combat.
    
    CE:25 - MapState: Battle
      Checkes three times if a battler on the Game Map is in battle. If after three (timed) tries no battle has been detected, it will unset S210 (MapState:Battle) and update the equipment.
      This was done to make shame work as intended, forcing the player to get dressed after the battle.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-21

    Added state trackers for (1) Player states and (2) Map Battle event.
    
    If a battler targets another event, it will now set the switch ON for the switch defined in Map::State::BATTLE
    When the player state changes (e.g. knockedout) it will trigger a switch on/off as defined in StateTracker.
    
    Added a hook module to make it easier with duckpunching. Requires that the class is defined, and HookExtension is included in the class.
    Use
      include HookExtension # add the ability to hook
      # register a hook for method method_name
      register_hook :method_name do |callee, return_value, *args|
        # callee = the method's object
        # return_value = the value returned from the call
        # *args = arguments passed to the method
      end

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-08-20

    Added the ability to call a map event by name call_event_by_name(event_name)
    
    Interpreter
      call_event(event[, event[, event ...]]])
        Execute one or more RPG::Game_Event events.
        The pages (command list) are taken
        based on RPGMaker XP's standard
        behaviour, and thus require that
        conditions are met, and the page
        furthest to the right is used.
    
      call_event_by_name(event_name)
        Run an event on the current map with the
        given name.
        Case-sensitive.
    
    Game_Event
      name
        returns the name of the event,
        set in the editor.
    
    call_event_by_name uses @@__map_events__ which
    indexes all the names of all events on the map.
    @@__map_events__ will only index the events on
    the map if call_event_by_name has been called.

    Calling a CE from a skill, item, etc. will now carry over the event/actor id to the CE.
    
    Instead of setting the event_id to 0 (Map), items (and other similar ways) will pass the event id of the object that requested the CE to be called.

    Rebalanced the normal and large goblins for bronze weapons.

    Changed folder layout for making releases easier.
    
    Moved the source files from the project folder, to the root folder. This will make it easier to when releasing the game (through script, or by hand) where you only need to package the Game folder.
    The reason why you don't want to package the src folder with the game is that the source is usless outside collaborative work, and takes 4-5 times the size of the binary files.
    
    Moved /Game_Data/source to /src
    Moved /Game_Data/utility to /utility
    Renamed /Game_Data /Game

    Made the parallel event remove the knocked out state in Dojo.
    
    The parallel event doesn't remove the knocked out state, and as such executed again as soon as the event had played through for the first time. This meant that the player was for every 20ms teleported into the dojo, making the persona update as they did so.

    Modified the join statement for variation points in get_picture_name.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-06-08

    Changed get_picture_name, variations now needs to be passed explicitly.
    
    get_picture_name is passed a filename (base) and an array of variation that can be added to the end of the base filename.
    i.e. (glob syntax)
    get_picture_name("Night", ["Terror", "Vision", "Shyamalan"])
    -> Night{ Terror,}{ Vision,}{ Shyamalan,}
    Matches:
    Night Terror Vision Shyamalan
    Night Terror Shyamalan
    Night Terror Vision
    Night Terror
    Night Vision Shyamalan
    Night Vision
    ...
    Night
    
    The matches are case insensitive as before
    i.e.
    get_picture_name("Night", ["Terror"])
    -> Night{ Terror,}
    Matches:
    night terror
    niGHt
    night TERROR
    ...etc
    
    Passing the exact bool, will make the variance required at the end of the filename
    
    
    Persona script updated to reflect the new changes.
    Chose face CE known to use get_picture_name, but doesn't seem to require an update at this time.

    MAP005 (Mrs Potts - Apron END): now visually matches MAP004 (Mrs Potts House).
    MAP008 (Garnets House): Dialog changes and fixed a minor dialog problem when switching from the intro (if you did the intro, the first line of text on this map had "MEN" saying it. That will no longer happen as blank name/face are now declared).
    MAP017 (Dali village - opening): now visually matches MAP001 (Dali Village [KTS]).
    MAP023 (aSlimyHumiliation): now visually matches MAP001 (Dali Village [KTS]) and has some minor dialog changes. Also, updated T51 to match visually with Dali (autotile1 set to 001-G_Water01, autotile2 set to 006-G_Road02).
    MAP111 (yeah I rpped the reiner house ;P): Adjusted movement and made a couple of dialog changes (I'll change the graphical look in a few days).
    MAP116 (Dali village - opening): now visually matches MAP001 (Dali Village [KTS]). I also changed the movement pattern for Garnet and made some minor dialogue changes.
    MAP148 (Wolf Clearing[KTS]): Updated transport location to match changes in MAP149.
    MAP149 (Garnets House - Upstairs): now visually matches MAP009 (Garnets House - Upstairs). Also, removed Garnet's persona from Wolf END.
    TileSets is included because of the changes to T51.

gegerlan <gegerlan2@hotmail.com>	2011-05-07

    Changed so equipment locks are stored in the actor, fix #108
    By default, locks are set by the editor and stored in a static file, onlt used for reading. This makes it impossible for changes of the actor architype in-game to be carried over to a save game, having the slave collar locked is therfor impossible with the current implementation of class changes.
    This fix stores the equipment locks in the save game instead. The first time the actor is loaded it will use the locks defined by the editor, but will then detatch itself from it, making all in-game changes seperate from the editor.
    Since locks are stored at the actor, each fix needs to be set by calling the actor object
    e.g.
    $game_party.actors[0].armor2_fix = true #lock body armor for the first actor in the party (Garnet)
    
    The common events for chaning class has been updated to reflect this change.
    The wolf event has been updated to reflect this change.
    
    Haz Armor script has been updated to call equip_fix?
